# restaurant-landing-page
A landing page using html and css

## Topics covered when creating this landing page:

### Box-Model
A box that wraps around every element, which includes content->padding->border->margin.
Every box is defaulted as `content-box`, you can modify it using `box-sizing: border-box` (which accounts for padding and border included.

###F loat Property
`float` The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow.

### Positioning
`position: static` Positioning that is the default order / original flow of the document

`position: relative`Positioning from relative to its normal static position in DOM.

`position: absolute` Allows positioning an element exactly where you want it. Can use top, right, bottom and left to set the location. Remember that these values will be relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning. If there is no such parent, it will default all the way back up to the <html> element relative to the page itself.

### CSS Specificity
-Classes vs IDs
-Inline vs External
-!important
-Order of the selector within the stylesheet

### Display
`block` Block level element that takes entire with like `<h1>`,`<div>`,`<p>`,`<ul>`,`<ol>`
`inline` Inline level element like a span tag.
`inline-block` Similar to Inline but can declare a height and width.
